There is one tutorial level and 3 normal levels. THE GOAL: to reach the teleporter and not get bitten by zombies. You can walk pressing basic A, S, D, W buttons on your keyboards. If the villager touches any of the white walls or zombies it will be respawned to the start of that level's first position. The zombies can move horizontally or vertically. Good luck!!!
